# Very basic oauth tutorial

The index.html file is well commented, so you should be able to get all the

means only one round-trip to the facebook server.

This is implemented without the use of SDK, and follows the steps at
[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/)

You can see the code in action by visiting

new app, then make sure you set the following parameters in the developer console.
